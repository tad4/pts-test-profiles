# Introduction
This repo contains a _fork_ of the [Phoronix Test Suite](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/)'s (PTS') test profiles.
- The test profiles here are **not** the official and authoritative PTS [test profiles](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/test-profiles) on GitHub!

This fork of PTS' test profiles contains modifications to PTS' official test profiles. The test profile modifications hosted in this repo could be fixes, enhancements, workarounds, experiments, or new features. If ever in doubt about using _any_ of the test profiles in this repo, it is highly recommended to use the corresponding official PTS test profile.

# Motivation
I've found the Phoronix Test Suite to be helpful. A few examples of PTS helpfulness for me are:
- PTS has allowed me to easily detect performance regressions in new releases of driver software;
- PTS allows me to easily compare performance across different CPUs and GPUs, and
- PTS enables me to track performance-over-time for various applications and drivers I rely upon.

As I've used PTS, I have found that I occasionally need to tweak test profiles for a specific machine, expand test profiles when I need to benchmark less popular CPU architectures, modify test profiles to support changes in the apps I'm benchmarking, and—on occasion—add new features for some test profiles I use. These modified test profiles are shared in the hope that they will be useful, but _without any warranty_; without even the implied warranty of _merchantability_ or _fitness for a particular purpose_. See the [warranty and disclaimer](#warranty-and-disclaimer) for more details.

# Test Profile Modifications
Modifications to test profiles are stored in branches, where each branch usually contains modifications for a single test case. Documentation about the changes made can be found in commit messages for a give branch, pull request descriptions and/or in this `readme.md` file.
